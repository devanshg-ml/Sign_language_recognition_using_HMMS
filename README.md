# Sign_language_recognition_using_HMMS
While there are many di erent types of gestures, the most structured sets
belong to the sign languages. In sign language, each gesture already has as-
signed meaning, and strong rules of context and grammar may be applied to
make recognition tractable. American Sign Language (ASL) is the language
of choice for most deaf people in the United States. ASLs grammar allows
more  exibility in word order than English and sometimes uses redundancy
for emphasis. Another variant, English Sign Language, has more in com-
mon with spoken English but is not in widespread use in America. ASL
uses approximately 6000 gestures for common words and  nger spelling for
communication of obscure words or proper nouns. Conversants in ASL may
describe a person, place, or thing and then point to a place in space to store
that object temporarily for later reference.

Hidden Markov models have intrinsic properties which make them very
attractive for sign language recognition. Explicit segmentation on the word
level is not necessary for either training or recognition. Language and con-
text models can be applied on several di erent levels, and much related
development of this technology has already been done by the speech recog-
nition community. Consequently, sign language recognition seems an ideal
machine vision application of HMM technology, o ering the bene ts of prob-
lem scalability, well de ned meanings, a pre-determined language model, a
large base of users, and immediate applications for a recognizer.
Conversant in ASL may describe a person, place or thing and then point
to a place in space to temporary store that object for later reference.

In this system, sentences of the form "personal pronoun, verb. noun,
adjective" are to be recognized. This sentence structure emphasizes the
need for a distinct grammar for ASL recognition and allows a large variety of
meaningful sentences to be randomly generated using words from each class.
Table 1 shows the words chosen for each class. Six personal pronouns,nine
verbs, twenty nouns, and  ve adjectives are included making the total lexicon
number forty words.
